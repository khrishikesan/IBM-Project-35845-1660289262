        1. Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle. Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels.

        2. Applying the CNN algorithm to the dataset.Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident.

        3.To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save human life.
